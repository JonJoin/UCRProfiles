*For G29, the two pedals' input are inverted on transfer to ViGem since the pedal input actually starts at 100% and reduces, versus the 0% and increase action in the ViGem / PS/Xbox controller
**ViGem as of writing doesn't support mapping to the XBox Guide button so this is left unmapped in the X360 config
***High axis (pulling back on the stick) sends input to ViGem's Cross / A Button, low axis (pitch forward) sends nothing (30 Deadzone for wiggle room at rest, can adjust as desired).
****To maintain the antideadzone but prevent flickering when swapping to M+KB, this button disables further transfer from steering to stick
